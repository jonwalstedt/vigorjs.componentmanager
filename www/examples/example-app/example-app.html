<h2>Example app</h2><p>This example app has a bit more complex setup. For instance it uses transitions and the add and remove options on the filter to add new components just before the animation starts and remove old components when the animation finishes.</p>
<p>The setup also uses the Vigor framework for its data layer to share data between the different components.</p>
<p>This example app is still in development and will be fleshed out in time.</p>
