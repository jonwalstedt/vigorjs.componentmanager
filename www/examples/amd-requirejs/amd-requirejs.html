<h2>AMD example using requirejs</h2><p>This is a small example of how you can let the componentManager require components using requirejs (amd).</p>
<p>The componentManager allows you to require components on demand (asynchronously) if you are using and AMD loader like requirejs.</p>
<p>Of course you can compile the project down to a single file and have all components batched together and loaded with the rest of the application to avoid unnecessary requests.</p>
<p>To try out the compiled version uncomment the script tag in index.jade and run:</p>
<div class="hljs javascript">
  <pre>node r.js -o build-vendors.js
node r.js -o build.js</pre>
</div>
