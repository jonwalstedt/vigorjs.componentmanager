<h2>Filter components by string matching</h2><p>You can use regexp on all the different way of string filtering (to match against the filterString - either pass regexp to the filter or define it in each instanceDefinition you want to act on the filterString).</p>
<p>You can of course use all the differed string filtering options at the same time (as any other filter) if you have a scenario that needs it.</p>
