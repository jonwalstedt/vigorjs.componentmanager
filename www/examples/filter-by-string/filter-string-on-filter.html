<h3>Example two - filterString on the filterObject</h3><p>These examples have the filterString defined on the filter passed to the refresh method. This approach is pretty much the opposite of the previous example - here the properties &quot;includeIfFilterStringMatches&quot; and &quot;excludeIfFilterStringMatches&quot; are set on the instanceDefinition. This allows for an easy way to filter instances on a common string defined on the filter instead of on each instanceDefinition.</p>
