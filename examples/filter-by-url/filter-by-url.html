<h2>Filter components by url</h2><p>You can filter components by specifying a url pattern for your instanceDefinition and then add the url fragment you want to filter on to the filter passed to the refresh method.</p>
<p>You can use any of the url patterns that Backbone supports as value for the urlPattern property on your instanceDefinition. The componentManager will filter out components that matches the url fragment passed to the filter and instantiate them with a urlParams object and a urlParamsCollection passed to the constructor function.</p>
