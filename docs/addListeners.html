<h3><a name="addListeners"></a> addListeners</h3><p>The addListeners method will wire up the componentManager to start listening for changes on conditions, componentDefinitions, instanceDefinitions and act upon those changes. It will also start triggering its own events.</p>
<p>This method will be called when initializing the componentManager, so you do not need to run this method unless you previously have removed the event listeners using <a href="#removeListeners">removeListeners</a>.</p>
<p>The addlisteners method returns the componentManager instance.</p>
