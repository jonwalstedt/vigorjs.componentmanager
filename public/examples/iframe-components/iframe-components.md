## Iframe Components

By setting a url as src attribute on the instance definition the componentManager will create an instance of the IframeComponent class to load the url in an iframe

The IframemComponent is exposed on the Vigor object so it's easy to extend it and create custom IframeComponents if additional logic is needed
