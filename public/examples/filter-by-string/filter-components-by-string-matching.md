## Filter components by string matching

You can use regex on all the different way of string filtering (to match against the filterString - either pass regex to the filter or define it in each instanceDefinition you want to act on the filterString).

You can of course use all the differed string filtering options at the same time (as any other filter) if you have a scenario that needs it.
