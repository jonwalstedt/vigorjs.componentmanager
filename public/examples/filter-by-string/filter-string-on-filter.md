### Example two - filterString on the filterObject
These examples have the filterString defined on the filter passed to the refresh method. This approach is pretty much the opposite of the previous example - here the properties "includeIfFilterStringMatches" and "excludeIfFilterStringMatches" are set on the instanceDefinition. This allows for an easy way to filter instances on a common string defined on the filter instead of on each instanceDefinition.
